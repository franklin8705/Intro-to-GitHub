# What the Hack: Intro-to-GitHub

## Introduction

This WhatTheHack project walks through the most common operations/features for intermediate level git and GitHub. 

So...What is GitHub? Do you git it?

First, git is a distributed version control system designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

GitHub is a secure, cloud based, version control tool.  To foster collaboration, GitHub uses git, the most popular open source version control software.

GitHub projects consist of repositories, which are containers that hold everything pertaining to the project.

Repositories (often referred to as "repos")  contain many features:
- Issues, are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs.
- Markdown files, automatically rendered files that are used to describe and detail the contents within the repo or folder.
- Project boards
- Wikis
- Insights.
